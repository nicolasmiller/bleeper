Audio synthesis bootstrap templates. 

Goal: make it easy to get up and running doing audio synthesis in as many languages as possible.

This is mainly for the purpose of satisfying my own curiosity about the relative ease of synthesizing audio with various languages and environments.
I also want to get more comfortable with audio algorithms in general (at the level of "hey sound hardware, here are some numbers, go").
